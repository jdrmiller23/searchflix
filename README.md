# Hey, hello, hiya! 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 

The purpose of this app was to explore react and basic API calls. 

## Feel free to play around

But... You will need your own API Key from https://themoviedb.org/. Learn more about the API here: https://developers.themoviedb.org/ 

Replace const api = ''; in src/searchMovies.js on line 15

Don't forget to use **npm install**.
